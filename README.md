# MinerVeinCoverage

Dyson Sphere Mod to show maximum miner speed in the UI. It should take into account all of your veins utilization upgrades and will work even if the miner is stopped or unpowered.

# Building

Run `dotnet build` from the directory. You will need to provide the referenced DLL's and place them in the `/lib` directory before you build.

# Installing

You can choose to download the zip file from the `dist` directory and use `r2modman`'s "Import local mod" functionality (in the Settings).
After testing it for a while I may try to submit it to Thunderstore.io to see if they'll host it.
